# FireworksWebApp
Web application utilizing JavaScript and HTML Canvas element for interactive fireworks show

This app was created as a test of jQuery knowledge in order to make a virtual fireworks show. Through randomization, mathematical formulas, and some logic, 
firework sprites are launched at a random area of the viewport and explode into a shower of additional particles and smoke. 

Instructions:

-Download ZIP file

-Unzip file in desired location (!IMPORTANT!) Do not change file structure of unzipped project, or rename files. This will break the application.

-Open the HTML document in preffered browser

-Randomized fireworks will begin automatically. Users can click on desired coordinates in the viewport in order to cause a sprite to be launched.
Click and hold down the mouse while dragging across the screen to create a finale!
